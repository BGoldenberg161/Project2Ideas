## Part 1

Review the [Project 2 requirements](https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/sei-ga-sea/11-projects/project-2#project-feedback-evaluation) and check out some [examples](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/sei-ga-sea/11-projects/past-projects/project2&sa=D&source=calendar&ust=1597596784944000&usg=AOvVaw1ihTzKFunxKsL2f6sIYdlC).

In this space below, list **THREE** ideas for your Project 2. For each idea, include [user stories](https://revelry.co/user-stories-that-dont-suck/) for each idea and a link to the API(s) you want to use for it.

--------------------------------------------------------
1. Air Quality app: [Breezometer](https://breezometer.com/products/air-quality-api) api gets air quality data via lat/long coords. Need another api to convert location to coords[locationIQ](https://locationiq.com/geocoding).

User Stories:  
I want to do my part to help the enviornment, but I don't know where to start, this app has been a great way for me to see the polution issues around me!    

I have bad allergies, I want to avoid going outdoors when conditions are bad so I can stay healthy


2. recipie book app: [spoontacular api](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) (look up recipies by allergies or by what is in the fridge add favorites)

User Stories: 
I have severe food allergies, but I still want delicious meals so I can keep my healthy life.. Without giving up extra time to find recipies that I can enjoy.  

When I don't want to go to the grocery store, I want to cook what I have and still have it taste good!

3. how to care for my plants app: [Trefle](https://docs.trefle.io/docs/guides/getting-started)(make watering schedule, calander to see all, trouble shooting)

User Stories:  
I've always wanted to have plants in my home, but historicly I always kill them, so this app has seriously upgraded my feng shui.

## Part 2

Sticking with idea 2: The recipie book!

In the space below:
* either embed or link a completed ERD for your approved P2 idea  

I believe I will only have 3 models, the user, starred recipies(ones to make again), and saved for later(ones I want to try, but have yet to get the chance)
* if there are any changes/additions to your user stories, place your full set of revised user stories here  

* either embed or link wireframes for every page of your app

### User Stories

I have severe food allergies, but I still want delicious meals so I can keep my healthy life.. Without giving up extra time to find recipies that I can enjoy.  

When I don't want to go to the grocery store, I want to cook what I have and still have it taste good, sometimes a little inspiration is all it takes!

I have always been a picky eater, but I want my guests to enjoy the meal also, I can have both with this app!
